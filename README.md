# ShowCase - The Home of Proof of Concepts
Welcome to **ShowCase**, a collection of projects, ideas, and experiments I‚Äôve worked on ‚Äî whether completed, attempted, or failed [hopefully this will be a place of only completed projects]. For me, programming is about exploring crazy ideas and trying to bring them to life. Most things can be created, and most problems solved, given enough time, effort, and simplifications.

## PokR - v1.0
**PokR** is a proof-of-concept tool designed to calculate the winning probability in Texas Hold'em poker (1 deck, 2-hand poker with 5 community cards). It combines object detection with automated probability calculation to make analyzing poker scenarios easy and efficient. This version, v1.0, works with both a physical camera and with screenrecording.\
*This project from the research, exploration, training, programming, fixing the gui, and writing the documentation has taken me 39 hours and 10 minutes.*
